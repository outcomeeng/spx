# Known Issues: 32-lint.enabler

## Repository lint migration quarantine

`eslint.config.ts` downgrades selected test-only lint rules from error to warning for paths listed in `eslint.test-lint-debt-nodes.json`.

The quarantined rule set is:

- `no-restricted-syntax` entries for assertion string literals and `readFileSync`
- `spx/no-hardcoded-spec-tree-node-kinds`
- `spx/no-hardcoded-spec-tree-node-states`

**Consequence:** `spx validation lint` remains portable for consuming projects, but this repository still carries test-string and registry-literal debt in the manifest paths.

**Remediation:** migrate the manifest-listed tests to import source-owned values or obtain inputs from generators, harnesses, or fixture files. Remove entries from `eslint.test-lint-debt-nodes.json` as each node is migrated; when the manifest is empty, remove the warning override block from `eslint.config.ts`.
